# Pizza `:->`

## Ingredients

::2 servings::

- ::3e2:: g of &lt;pizza&gt; flour
- `<::190::>` g of water
- ::3:: g of salt
- ::9.01:: g of sugar
- ::1:: packs of yeast
- ::12:: g of olive oil

## Preparations

- Mix all the dry components (flour, salt, sugar, yeast) together in a bowl.
- Add the water. Mix until combined, i.e. no more loose flour. (Recommended
  handmixer, hands work too.)
- Add the oil. Mix until combined smoothly, i.e. no more visible shiny oil.
- Now mix for at least 10 more minutes by hand. Or continue to use the
  handmixer, for about 5 minutes. In general the result will just get better the
  longer you mix, do not overdo it however.
- Split the dough into ::2:: equal portions by weight. Place each in a pre-oiled
  bowl. Make sure to swirl the dough around in the bowl so it too is oiled from
  all sides.

Let the dough rise, for about 20-35 minutes (depending on room temperature), or
until just about doubled in size.

### Baking

For extra brown crust in an oven that does not get very hot, pre-bake each
spread out portion with just the sauce and any other hard ingredients for about
3 minutes. Then add the cheese and let bake until gold brown.

```
You will have <i>successfully</i> **baked** &lt;::2::&gt; pizzas!
